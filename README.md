# Route planning in occupancy grid with A star search and probabilistic roadmaps
# Path Planning Algorithms in Python

This repository includes three Python implementations of path planning algorithms designed to navigate a 2D environment represented as an occupancy grid. These techniques are fundamental in robotics and AI for autonomous navigation in known environments.
